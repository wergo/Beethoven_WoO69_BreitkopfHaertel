# DRAFT encoding template

This repository contains an [MEI](https://music-encoding.org) encoding of [9 Variations on "Quanto è bello l'amor contadino" (WoO 69) by Ludwig van Beethoven, Breitkopf und Härtel edition, 1862–90. Plate B.167.](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/53030) 

**Note: The MEI header still needs to be FRBRized. **

We hope that this repository will eventually serve as an encoding template for wider use within the [TROMPA](https://trompamusic.eu) project. For now, no assurances are made regarding the validity or consistency of this encoding or its structure.
